                                <p>Every handset we review is tested using the same combination of real-world use cases and repeatable benchmark tests. This means that we test everything from battery life and processor performance during the full range of everyday tasks, right up to call quality and screen calibration.</p>
								
                                <p>Phones are also now our go-to devices for taking photos, so the cameras are put through their paces in every situation possible. You want to know whether a phone's camera will impress not just in bright sunshine at an exotic location, but also when taking shots of moving people at drunken parties, or just in the dull, flat light of a British winter.</p>
								
                                <p>Similarly, you might want to know how your phone will cope with a Netflix binge or video call, so our battery-discharge tests take that into account. Most of all, we take these phones out and use them as our own over an extended period, living with them to learn their quirks and discover their hidden treasures.</p>
								<h5>SAMSUNG GALAXY S9 AND GALAXY S9 PLUS</h5>
								<h5>Pros:</h5>
                                    <p>Fantastic screen </p>

                                    <p>Feels great</p>

                                    <p>Improved speakers</p>
								<h5>Cons:</h5>
								<p>Average battery life</p>

                                   <p>Dual-sensor only on Plus model</p>

                                   <p> Some lag with Samsung's software</p>

                                   <p> You can't go wrong with either the Galaxy S9 or Galaxy S9 Plus, though if we had to recommend one we'd go with the latter-and that's because it comes with a dual-camera. The extra lens, in this instance, is used for zooming, making the camera far more versatile.

                                    <p>Both the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus sport an identical build and similar internals, with the main differences being that the Plus model is equipped with an additional 2GB of RAM, a slightly bigger battery and the aforementioned dual-camera configuration-luxuries most customers should be able to live without.</p>

                                    <p>The biggest update Samsung treated the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus to is a new variable aperture setting within the camera, letting customers switch between an f/2.4 and f/1,5 aperture whenever they see fit, which should ensure images come out bright and full of detail in almost all low-light environments. </p>
								<h5>APPLE IPHONE X</h5>
                                <h5>Pros: </h5>
                                    <p>Stunning screen </p>

                                    <p>The best-looking iPhone ever</p>

                                    <p>Improved speakers</p>
                                     <p> Face ID is much better than Touch ID</p>

                                <h5>Cons:</h5>
                                    <p>Software needs more optimisation for the taller screen and notch</p>

                                    <p>No fast-charging plug included</p>

                                    <p> Very expensive</p>
                                <h5>HUAWEI P SMART</h5>
                                <h5>Pros: </h5>
                                    <p>Great 18:9 screen </p>

                                    <p>Heaps of value</p>

                                    <p>Slick design</p>
                                <h5>Cons:</h5>
                                    <p>Frustrating EMUI software</p>

                                    <p>No fast-charging</p>

                                    <p>Some issues with build quality</p>

                                    <p>Customers on a stricter budget should turn their attention to the Huawei P Smart. Sure, it doesn't have the most interesting name, but it is - in my opinion, at least - the best affordable handset out there, offering users access to high-end hardware, including an aluminium body, for a fraction of the cost of a flagship.

                                    Under the hood, there's a 5.65-inch 18:9 screen, a Kirin 659 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable internal storage and a 3000mAh battery. There's also a dual-camera setup on the rear (13MP + 2MP) that's not too bad in well-lit environments, but misses the mark at night. At 179, though, it's an absolute steal.</p>
